	    <h2>About Me</h2>
	    <p>Hi! I'm Krishna. I work at Independent Software, based in New Haven, CT.</p>
	    <p>On the previous slide, you saw the New Haven skyline, as seen from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Rock">East Rock</a>.</p>
	    <p>This slide is obviously a picture of me.</p>

	    <h2>Apprentice100</h2>
	    <p>I'm the Program Director of the A100 Program -- a software developer talent accelerator. In a three month cycle, we gather together a Cohort of 20-25 CS majors to train them in the craft of software development.</p>
	    <p>For the first month, we work collaboratively on projects like this site, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Twitter Bootstrap.</p>
	    <p>In the second month, we introduce them to the back end side of web application development, focusing on integrating PHP and MySQL with a minimal, effective front end.</p>

	    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
	    <p>You can catch me singing with The Citations, the graduate student a cappella group at Yale.</p>

		<p>From time to time, I've been known to <a href="http://mobro.co/LordKrishna">raise money for charity</a> through outrageous facial hair as seen here.</p>

		<p>And, of course, I enjoy coding! Each week, I host a <a href="http://meetup.com/a100-dev-community">weekly Meetup</a> to get new and veteran developers togather to hack on open source projects.</p>
