New Parallax-based site

Backlog:
 - Move Slide 1 so it's not blocking my face! (Or find an alternate image to use).
 - Refactor existing code to remove use of div id for too many items.
 - Refactor to allow for modular slide creation (instead of 'slide1', 'slide 2', etc.).
 - Add more images of Apprentices working.
 - Add new slide for each line of text (or at least per idea?).
 - Use alternating black-and-white and color images, for visual variety?
 - Add a section with pictures of family?
